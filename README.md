### Project Overview
This is an implementation of a multi-threaded web server that handles "requests" and reports successes and failures in the terminal via logging. A similar program was created in Go-language to examine the pros of cons of both languages as well as the performance between the two as Go is designed with concurrecny and scalability in mind.
